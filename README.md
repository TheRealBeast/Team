Passionate coder with a background in Business & Administration; seeker of new challenges, new problems to solve and new ways to test and hone my skills; **puzzle-solver for a living**.

Eager to learn something new **every waking day**, I discovered the joy and pleasure of "dirtying" my hands with analysis tools and programming whenever I get the chance; **competitive coding** in particular helped me a lot, offering me **highly diversified algorithm-based** problems, motivation and the chance to learn **best practices** from veteran coders.

A **teacher** at heart, I had been fortunate enough to pass what little I know to many people, thanks to my professional and **volunteer** activity. Interested in both corporate and start-up work experiences.

### Graphic Designer :us: :man:

- [Harley A](https://www.upwork.com/fl/harleya)

As a relative newcomer to graphic design, I have some limitations, but I think I have some talent too. You won’t catch me doing videos or anything that requires coding, but I love creating attention grabbing designs. 

I can do some basic 3D work, or effects, but mostly you’ll see flat design and some very basic cell shading. I think I’m pretty good at color and layout. **Logos**, **posters**, **flyers**, **banners**, photo editing, etc. are my thing and I achieve some success through **LOTS of communication**. My clients help me to succeed thank you. 

It might be worth mentioning that I use software from **Serif Software** in the UK, their older apps and their new line of Affinity Design and Affinity Photo. This means I can output most of the formats you might need if they are not too publisher dependent. 

You can find me at the PC periodically throughout the day and night, about six days a week, right here in Arizona.
